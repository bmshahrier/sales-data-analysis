# Sales Data Analysis with Excel

The company sells bicycles and accessories, such as clothing and other accessories to bikers in six countries. I have analysed 6 years data (more than one hundred thousand rows) in Excel using excel table, pivot table, pivot charts, slicer etc.
I have analysed and develop a Dashboard with year over year sales trend analysis, sliced into different categories, subcategories, customer demographics and countries.

Report for profitability analysis on the product category and sub-category, for specific year.



Furthermore, sales difference (growth) report for Product Category and Sub Category between two years has been developed with the filtering options including Country, Customer Gender and Age Group.
